        <h4>What will happen to the Winner</h4>
        <p>All of the teams in the AL central are Mediocre at best<br>
            Zach Meisel of the Athletic says <blockquote>  Well, this is a division that no one seems to want to win</blockquote> <br\>
            This scrum over the next 30 days will be entertaining as well as painful, however, the winner gets a playoff spot, more specifically the third seed in the AL
